# miel.js 🚗⛵

> ⚠️ **Alpha** — This project is experimental. Expect bugs, missing assets, and incomplete features.

🇳🇱 [Nederlandse versie](README.nl.md)

A JavaScript/Phaser remake of the classic **Miel Monteur** (Mulle Meck) games, combining both the Cars and Boats games into one unified experience.

## What is this?

miel.js recreates the beloved Miel Monteur games in the browser using [Phaser CE](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce). Assets are extracted from the original CD-ROM ISOs, and all game logic has been reverse-engineered from the original Macromedia Director/Lingo source.

### Combined Games via World Select

The original games were released as two separate titles. Interestingly, the first game (cars) contained Lingo code for a **World Select** screen that would allow switching between worlds — but it was never activated, likely due to complexity or time constraints.

miel.js brings this unused feature to life, merging both games through World Select:

- 🚗 **Blauwwater** — the original car-building game (*Miel Monteur bouwt auto's*)
- ⛵ **Scheepswerf** — the boat-building game (*Miel Monteur recht door zee*)

### Boats Game Features

The boats game includes full recreations of:

- **Boat building** at the Scheepswerf (shipyard) with junk pile parts
- **Sailing** across the sea world with weather, currents, and navigation
- **NPC missions** — Birgit, the Preacher, Mia, George, the Fisherman, the Surfer, the Lighthouse keeper, and more
- **Diving**, cave exploration, and the showboat
- **Album** system for collecting completed boats

### Lingo Parity

All game logic was extracted from the original Director/Lingo scripts using a custom recursive descent parser. The JS implementations are verified against 10,863 AST-generated tests with 100% parity.

## Requirements

You need the original CD-ROM ISOs in any supported language. They are available on the Internet Archive:

## Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest way to run is with Docker:

```bash
# Download ISOs from archive.org and place them in iso/
mkdir -p iso
# (or use the build script: python3 build_scripts/build.py nl download)

# Build and run (set GAME_LANG to your language: nl, de, sv, en, no, da)
docker build -f Dockerfile.boten --build-arg GAME_LANG=nl -t mielboten .
docker run -p 8082:80 mielboten
```

Then open http://localhost:8082

## Manual Build

### Dependencies

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip ffmpeg imagemagick nodejs npm optipng p7zip-full libvorbis-dev
```

**Linux (Arch):**
```bash
sudo pacman -S python python-pip ffmpeg imagemagick nodejs npm
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg imagemagick optipng p7zip node
```

### Build Steps

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Extract assets from both ISOs (replace 'nl' with your language)
python3 build_scripts/build.py nl download        # cars
python3 build_scripts/build.py nl download-boats   # boats

# Build assets
python3 assets.py 0 assets_nl

# Build and start dev server
npm run build
npm start
```
